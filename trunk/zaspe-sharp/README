We use prebuild to make the solution and projects files for MonoDevelop,
SharpDevelop, NAnt or Visual Studio, according to your needs.


1. MonoDevelop

So, if you work on GNU/Linux and MonoDevelop, you can generate mds and mdp
files running prebuild.exe:

	$ mono prebuild.exe /target monodev /file zaspe-sharp.xml

Now you can open the solution file ZaspeSharp.mds with MonoDevelop.


2. NAnt

It does not work very well. It does not manage correcly gtk-sharp references.
It's necesary to use -pkg:gtk-sharp to compile with Mono, but I think NAnt
does't manage this correctly.

// TODO: Explanation for SharpDevelop

NOTE: Prebuild version included here is not the original. It's a modified
version, based in release 2.0.1.
