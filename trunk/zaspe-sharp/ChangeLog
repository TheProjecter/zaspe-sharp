	* ReportGenerator/ReportGUI.cs: ReportGUI is Modal now. When opened,
	  ReportGUI selects the actual event. ".pdf" extension added if not
	  present when choosing a file. Reports can be maked only if the needed
	  data exists.
	* GUI/MainWindow.cs: Removed debugging console output.
	* GUI/About.cs: Now "Zaspe#" is explicitly set.
	* ZaspeSharp.mds: ChangeLog update activated.
