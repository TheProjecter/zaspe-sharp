ZaspeSharp is developed in C#. You need the .NET Runtime 2.0 on Windows, and
Mono 1.2 (I don't know if it works with older versions) on GNU/Linux.

Graphical user interface is made with Gtk# 2.10.1, so you need to download the
runtime from the web site and install it if you plan to run ZaspeSharp on
Windows. If you use GNU/Linux, download and install the appropriate package.

Compilation
-----------

We use Prebuild to make the solution and projects files for MonoDevelop,
SharpDevelop, Visual Studio and NAnt, according to your needs.

You have to run the GUI project after compilation has finished.


1. MonoDevelop (tested with version 0.14)

So, if you work on GNU/Linux and MonoDevelop, you can generate mds and mdp
files running prebuild.exe:

	$ mono prebuild.exe /target monodev /file zaspe-sharp.xml

Now you can open the solution file ZaspeSharp.mds with MonoDevelop.


2. SharpDevelop (tested with version 2.2)

With SharpDevelop on Windows, steps are similar like MonoDevelop:

	> prebuild.exe /target sharpdev2 /file zaspe-sharp.xml

Now you can open the solution file ZaspeSharp.sln. If you are using version
1.x, you have to replace sharpdev2 by sharpdev.


3. Visual Studio

4. NAnt (tested with version 0.85-ubuntu)

4.1 NAnt under GNU/Linux (Ubuntu Feisty Fawn)

To compile ZaspeSharp under Mono, we need to specify "-pkg:" option to gmcs
compiler, not "-r". This is not handled very well by Prebuild. Also, after
compilation with NAnt, it's necesary to copy some files to output directory.

So, steps to compile with NAnt under Mono are:

	* Run:
		$ mono prebuild.exe /target nant /file zaspe-sharp.xml
	
	* Edit GUI/GUI.exe.build. Remove these lines in target "winexe":

                <include name="atk-sharp.dll" />
                <include name="gdk-sharp.dll" />
                <include name="glade-sharp.dll" />
                <include name="glib-sharp.dll" />
                <include name="gtk-sharp.dll" />

	  and add these ones after resources structure:

		<pkg-references>
			<package name="glib-sharp-2.0" />
			<package name="gtk-sharp-2.0" />
			<package name="glade-sharp-2.0" />
		</pkg-references>

	* Run:
		$ nant

	* Copy these files to output directory (GUI/bin/Debug or GUI/bin/Release):

		Database/data.db
		Gentle.NET/Gentle.config
		Gentle.NET/libsqlite3.so.0 (on GNU/Linux)
		Gentle.NET/sqlite3.dll (on Windows)
		Gentle.NET/Mono.Data.SqliteClient.dll
		GUI/glade/*.glade
		GUI/resources/blue_fea.gif

	* Run GUI.exe:
		$ mono GUI.exe


4.2 NAnt under Windows XP

NOTE: Prebuild version included here is not the original. It's a modified
version, based in release 2.0.1.
