We use prebuild to make the solution and projects files for MonoDevelop,
SharpDevelop, NAnt or Visual Studio, according to your needs.

So, if you work on GNU/Linux and MonoDevelop, you can generate mds and mdp
files running prebuild.exe:

	$ mono prebuild.exe /target monodev /file zaspe-sharp.xml

Now you can open the solution file ZaspeSharp.mds with MonoDevelop.

// TODO: Explanation for NAnt

NOTE: Prebuild version included here is not the original. It's a modified
version, based in release 2.0.1.
