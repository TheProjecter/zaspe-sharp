Bugs
----

* Date of events must be carrefully revised. What happen if an event is added
on 30 of December with date 5 of January? _Year_ of that date must be set
correctly.


Improvements
------------

* Internationalization support: Maybe with Mono.Unix, but I don't know if it
can be easily used with the MS .NET Framework.

* Revision of README file.
