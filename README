You need to download the sources of Medsphere's Gtk# 2.10.1 installer
from here (subversion needed):

$ svn co http://openvista.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openvista/gtksharp-win32-installer/tags/2.10.1-1/

Then replace the files you have just checkout with these. Don't forget
to check the variables in the files 'build.bat' and 'incoming_to_sdk.bat'
(the last one if you want to replace the Gtk+ of the installer with a
copy of the Ivan's one).
